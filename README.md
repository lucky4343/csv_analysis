 # csv_analysis
To prepare for analysis, enter bin directory with table_specs file.
Run bash script in this fashion:

./table_specs ***.csv ***.csv **.csv
(*** indicates name of input file -- you may enter up to nine .csv files)

This will create output files for each .csv which it will then export to an output folder.
